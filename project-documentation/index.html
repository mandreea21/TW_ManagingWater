        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The report aims to describe the uses of a web system for Managing Water Turbines, along with how did our team go about implementing such a web application.
        </p>
        <p>
            In today's time, many applications have a web interface, since it's easy to use for both clients and developers who need to find data about a specific topic. Unlike a desktop application for example, a web application is more easily customizable and managable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main audiance for this report are people who are interested in web applications for managing different types of real life systems, as well as people who are interested in the concrete applications of a System for Managing Water Turbines.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of this application is to assist in visualising, comparing and adding different water turbines around the world. The main benefit of such a web system is, of course, the user-friendliness that it provides for the specific tassk. Our objectives
            in developing this app are to help people interested in such a system have a better experience for managing and visualising Water Turbines.
        </p>

            <h3>Operating environment and design constraints</h3>
            <p>
                This web application can be used in any operation system (Windows, Mac, Linux) that supports one of the main web browsers (like Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge). Some design constraints will appear because of the different ways different browsers
                interpret HTML, CSS, but the general functionalities should be the same.

        <h2>External Interface Requirements</h2>
        <section id="person-org">
            <!-- review? -->
            <h3>User Interfaces</h3>
            <p>
                Our web application will provide diffenet sub-pages for the user management system and the hydropower plant management system. For the user management system, there will be pages for choosing between signup/login, and pages for the sign up and log in
                systems. For the hydropower plant management system, there will be: a page for getting information about the biggest capacity hydropower plants around the world, a page for getting the list of hydropower plants around the world, a page
                for querying for a specific hydropower plant and visialising details about it and a page for users to define their own hydropower plants.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="roles">
            <h3>Backend Interfaces</h3>
            <p>
                For the backend, different interfaces (classes) will be managing the import of external data about hydropower plants, the querying to an embedded database of such water turbines, the querying to a table of users (for adding and checking the validity of
                accounts).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="actions">
            <h3>Communication Interfaces</h3>
            <p>
                These interfaces will manage the communication between frontend and backend, managing different HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH etc.), and returning the requested data, if needed.

        <h2>System Features</h2>
        <h3>User Management</h3>
        <p>
            This application will be able to manage users. Such users can sign in with a new account (username, password, email), in which case the system will add that account (with the password hashed) to the user table in the embedded database, and users can also
            log in with an existing account (requiring username or email and password to be valid), in which case the database will be queryed to find if such an account exists.
        </p>
        <h3>Biggest Water Turbines Visualization</h3>
        <p>
            The system will import data about Water Turbines around the world, and users that are logged in will be able to visualize the biggest water turbines existing in the database. Users will be able to see turbine's location, electric power generated, capacity,
            frequency of rotation, rated speed, average energy production and the turbines used with Fracis type 4 x 56,5 MW vertical axis.
        </p>
        <h3>Seach for a specific Turbine</h3>
        <p>
            Users will be able to search for a water turbine's name, and if it exists in the database, information about it (mentioned earlier) will be shown, along with it's status (in use, defective etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>Templates for user-defined Water Turbines</h3>
        <p>
            Users will also be able to define their own template Water Turbines, feature which will help project the ideas and visialise how their defined hydropower plant will function, depending of the given specifications.
        </p>
